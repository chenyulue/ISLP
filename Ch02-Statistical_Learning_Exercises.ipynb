    "1. **Answers to the 1st question:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (a) A flexible method is better, because we have enough data to fit the model and it will overcome overfitting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (b) A flexible method is worse, because the number of observations *n* is small, and a highly flexible method may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (c) A flexible method is better, because a highly flexible method can fit the non-linear relationship better.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (d) A flexible method is worse, because more flexible method may gives more variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Answers to the 2nd question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a) A regression problem with the interest in inference, where $n=500, p=4$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (b) A classification problem with the interest in prediction, where $n=20, p=14$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (c) A regression problem with the interest in prediction, where $n=52$ (number of weeks in 2012), $p=4$\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Answers to the 3rd quetionï¼š**\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a) ![sketch](3-a.jpg)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (b) The reason of the shape:\n",
    "        Variance, which has low value for lower flexibility and increases as the flexibility increases.\n",
    "        Bias, which has high value for lower flexibility and decreases as the flexibility increases.\n",
    "        Bayes error, which is the constant irreducible error.\n",
    "        Train error, which decreases monotonously because the increase in flexibility makes the fitting model fit in the pattern in the training data set.\n",
    "        Test error, which first decreases with the bias due to the model fitting the relationship better and better, and increases after the minimum because of overfitting.\n",
