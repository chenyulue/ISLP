Alternative fitting procedures can yield better *prediction accuracy* and *model interpretability*:

* *Prediction Accuracy*: 

  Provided that the true relationship between the response and the predictors is approximately linear, the least squares estimates will have low bias.

  * $n \gg p$:  the least squares estimates tend to also have low variance.
  * $n \simeq p$:
